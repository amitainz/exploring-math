This repo contains some tutorials I've prepared, to give
my daughter and some of her friends a taste of cool things in math.

You can use and share them, just give credit where credit is due.

I haven't thought much about licensing, except I would not like this 
to be used for commercial purposes, and I would like to retain
whatever copy rights I have.

Feel free to email me at amitai.zernik@gmail.com to discuss further.


Note to self: this is a cleaned version of the gal-cbc private repo.
