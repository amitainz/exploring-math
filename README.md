# Exploring Math

This repo contains tutorials for guided exploration of some cool things in math and its applications.
They're designed for kids of different ages (well, my daughters' ages really,
but they seem determined to keep growing up).

Some of them form parts of an escape-room-like game, but they can each be done independently.
